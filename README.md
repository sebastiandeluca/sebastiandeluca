## Hey, I'm Sebastian Deluca.


I'm an aspiring software developer currently studying Computing at Queen's University.![MySchool](images/QU.jpg)

I enjoy solving problems, as well as learning what coding is capable of achieving.

I'm currently proficient in Python, and plan on expanding my skillset to include JavaScript & C++ after my term ends.

I currently have two and a half years of coding experience under my belt-- however, this experience comes from trying new things, as well as from school. I always aspire to try my best and go above and beyond what's expected of me, but above all, I love to code.
