## Hey, I'm Sebastian Deluca.


I'm an aspiring software developer currently studying Computing at Queen's University. I enjoy finding creative solutions to problems, coding, and learning just how expansive the capabilities of code are.

Currently, I am proficient in Python, and knowledgable in JavaScript. I also intend to learn C++ at some point in the near future.

One of my greatest achievements coding-wise is the pygame-based Prism-- With 3 of my friends under a fake company named "Foo Games", we created a unique storytelling experience as well as created a game that is enjoyable to play, has a lot of replayability, and pushes pygame to its limits.

I currently have two and a half years of coding experience under my belt, even though this experience comes from trying new things, as well as from school projects. I always aspire to try my best and go above and beyond what's expected of me, but above all, I love to code!
